== Pre-release versions ==

If you are trying a pre-release theme release (RC, for release candidate), let me say thanks. It's quite necessary for themes to be tested considerately before they find they can be considered 'final' and ready for public consumptions.

Simply be warned that these pre-release versions are about 95% complete, that they may contain bugs, and that if you make me aware of a problem I'm going to address it. Because that's why this is here after all.


=== Reporting Issues ===

If you see a bug, something that doesn't look right, or experience an odd behavior by the theme files themselves, please [FilingIssues report it]. Don't keep it to yourself.

Instead of trying to send me an email directly, please feel free to file any issue you see as a potential problem on the [http://code.google.com/p/barthelme/issues/list issues tab]. This will help track any problems and make sure they are addressed.
