BRIEFLY
Thanks for downloading the Simplr theme. I hope it works for you.

INSTALLATION

VERSIONS
"Simplr 1.x" has been tested with WordPress 2.0+. This theme uses a function.php file that only works with WordPress 2.0+. Simplr 1.x has been tested with Widgets 1.0. And it worked!

"Simpr OV1" has been created for versions of WordPress prior to 2.0.x, like WordPress 1.5.x and WordPressMU. It is the same as v1.x except that it has no Widgets support nor a theme options window. And it will probably never be updated. Otherwise it's the same.

IMPORTANT 
I strongly suggest visiting http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/plaintxtblog/ as it is quite likely that I'll have caught some major flaw in the design. Hopefully I'll get them all.

THANKS
I'd like to thank Raoul for permission to use his Simple Recent Comments Plugin v0.1 http://www.raoul.shacknet.nu/ in the Simplr theme. Thanks, Raoul.
